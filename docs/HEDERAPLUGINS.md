# Available Tools

The Hedera Agent Kit provides a comprehensive set of tools organized into **plugins** by the type of Hedera service they
interact with. These tools can be used by an AI agent, like the ones in the `typescript/examples` folder, and enable a
user to interact with Hedera services using natural language.
